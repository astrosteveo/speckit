# SpecKit Enhancements Constitution

**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Version**: 1.0

## Purpose

Transform SpecKit from a solid foundation into a production-ready, installable development toolkit with best-in-class UX that developers can install and use immediately - just like any other npm package.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Installation Simplicity**: Users should go from `npm install speckit` to running their first workflow in under 2 minutes, with zero configuration required.

2. **Clear Feedback**: Users always know what's happening, what to do next, and why. No cryptic errors, no silent failures, no confusion.

3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple workflows by default, but advanced features are discoverable and accessible when users need them.

4. **Fail Gracefully**: When things go wrong (and they will), provide helpful, actionable error messages and recovery paths. Never leave users stuck.

5. **Claude Agent SDK Native**: Built from the ground up to leverage the full capabilities of Claude's agent system - not bolted on or hacked around.

## Priorities

What this enhancement project optimizes for, in order:

1. **Developer Experience**: Smooth onboarding, intuitive workflows, helpful errors, delightful to use
2. **Production Reliability**: Battle-tested stability, comprehensive test coverage, zero surprises in production
3. **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture that lets users customize SpecKit for their specific needs and project types

## Non-Negotiables

Things we will NOT compromise on:

1. **Test coverage â‰¥80%** - Every new feature requires comprehensive tests before merging
2. **Zero breaking changes** - Existing workflows and `.speckit/` states must continue working
3. **Zero runtime dependencies** - Keep SpecKit lean, secure, and free from npm dependency hell
4. **Claude Agent SDK compliance** - Must use the SDK properly, following best practices and patterns
5. **Documentation excellence** - No feature ships without documentation, examples, and integration tests

## Success Definition

This project succeeds when:

1. **Installable**: Users can `npm install -g speckit` and immediately run `speckit init` in any directory
2. **Self-documenting**: SpecKit automatically generates and maintains documentation from specs and code
3. **SDK-native**: Seamless integration with Claude Agent SDK features (no workarounds or hacks)
4. **Backward compatible**: 100% compatibility with existing `.speckit/` workflows created in v1.0
5. **Production proven**: At least 3 real projects built successfully using the enhanced SpecKit

## Decision Framework

When making technical or product decisions, ask in order:

1. Does it serve the core purpose? (Production ready + Best UX)
2. Does it align with our guiding principles?
3. Does it respect our priorities?
4. Does it violate any non-negotiables?

If a decision passes all checks, it's likely the right call.

- Global CLI: `speckit init`, `speckit status`, etc.
- Smart project detection and setup
- Zero-config defaults that just work

### 2. Documentation Standards (Built-in Feature)
- Auto-generate API docs from code
- Auto-generate user docs from specs
- Keep docs in sync with implementation
- Enforce documentation quality gates
- Output in multiple formats (Markdown, HTML, PDF)

### 3. Claude Agent SDK Integration
- Proper agent lifecycle management
- Native tool usage patterns
- State persistence via SDK
- Error handling best practices

### 4. Enhanced UX
- Clear progress indicators
- Helpful error messages with recovery steps
- Interactive prompts with sensible defaults
- Colorful, readable terminal output
- Status dashboard showing workflow state

### 5. Extensibility
- Plugin architecture
- Custom agent definitions
- Custom quality validators
