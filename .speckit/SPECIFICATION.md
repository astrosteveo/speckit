# SpecKit Enhancements Specification

**Version**: 2.0
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: Draft

## Overview

Transform SpecKit from a solid foundation (v1.0) into a production-ready, globally installable development toolkit that developers can install via npm and use immediately. This enhancement focuses on six key areas: npm installation and distribution, global CLI interface, automatic documentation generation, proper Claude Agent SDK integration, enhanced user experience with clear feedback and progress indicators, and a plugin architecture for extensibility.

The goal is to enable developers to go from `npm install -g speckit` to running their first workflow in under 2 minutes with zero configuration required, while maintaining 100% backward compatibility with existing v1.0 `.speckit/` workflows.

**Success Threshold**: This specification must achieve an overall quality score of 85% or higher across completeness (85%), clarity (90%), and testability (80%) metrics.

## Functional Requirements

### FR001: Global NPM Installation and Package Distribution

**Description**: Enable installation of SpecKit as a global npm package that can be invoked from any directory using the `speckit` command. The package must include proper bin configuration, entry point setup, file permissions for executables, and all necessary files bundled for distribution. Installation must complete in under 30 seconds on a standard internet connection with no errors or warnings.

**Priority**: Critical

**Testability**:
- Verify `npm install -g speckit` completes successfully in <30 seconds
- Verify `speckit --version` returns correct version number
- Verify `speckit --help` displays usage information
- Verify installation works on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- Verify no npm warnings or errors during installation
- Verify uninstallation with `npm uninstall -g speckit` removes all files

**Details**:
- Add `bin` field to package.json pointing to CLI entry point
- Create executable CLI entry script with proper shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env node`)
- Set executable permissions on CLI files
- Include all necessary files in npm package (use `files` field in package.json)
- Test installation on all major platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Provide both global (`-g`) and npx usage patterns
- Ensure zero runtime dependencies (dev dependencies allowed for testing)

### FR002: Interactive Project Initialization with Smart Detection

**Description**: Implement `speckit init` command that initializes SpecKit in any directory by creating the `.speckit/` directory structure, generating default configuration files (state.json, CONSTITUTION.md template), detecting existing project metadata (package.json, git repository), and providing interactive prompts for project details with sensible defaults. The command must complete initialization in under 5 seconds and detect if SpecKit is already initialized to prevent accidental overwrites.

**Priority**: Critical

**Testability**:
- Verify `speckit init` creates `.speckit/` directory structure
- Verify `state.json` is created with correct schema and initial values
- Verify constitution template is copied to `.speckit/CONSTITUTION.md`

- Display success message with next steps after initialization

---

### FR003: Workflow Status Dashboard with Real-Time Monitoring

**Description**: Implement `speckit status` command that displays a comprehensive dashboard showing current workflow phase, completion status of each phase (constitute, specify, plan, implement), quality scores for completed phases with color-coded indicators, recent activity log with timestamps, and next recommended actions.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR001: Performance - Fast Execution and Minimal Latency

**Description**: All SpecKit operations must execute within defined time bounds to ensure responsive user experience. Installation must complete in under 30 seconds, initialization in under 5 seconds, status checks in under 1 second, documentation generation in under 10 seconds for projects <100 files, quality validation in under 5 seconds for documents <5000 lines, and plugin loading in under 2 seconds for <20 plugins. Performance must be measured and validated in CI pipeline.

**Metric**: Execution time in seconds measured using performance.now() before and after each operation

**Target**:
- Installation: <30 seconds
- Initialization: <5 seconds
- Status check: <1 second
- Documentation generation: <10 seconds (projects <100 files)
- Quality validation: <5 seconds (documents <5000 lines)
- Plugin loading: <2 seconds (<20 plugins)

**Rationale**: Developers expect fast, responsive tools. Slow operations lead to frustration and abandonment. Fast execution times enable rapid iteration and workflow efficiency.

---

### NFR002: Reliability - Zero Data Loss and Graceful Error Recovery

**Description**: SpecKit must handle errors gracefully without data loss or corruption of state files. All state mutations must be atomic (write to temp file, then rename), interrupted operations must be resumable from last checkpoint, error messages must be actionable with recovery steps, and the system must never leave the project in an inconsistent state. Reliability must be tested through fault injection and chaos testing.

**Metric**: Number of error scenarios with successful recovery measured through fault injection testing

**Target**:
- 100% of state mutations are atomic (no partial writes)
- 100% of interrupted operations can be resumed
- 0 instances of state corruption in fault injection tests
- 95%+ of errors include actionable recovery steps

**Rationale**: Data loss destroys trust and productivity. State corruption can break entire projects. Graceful error handling ensures developers can recover from failures without losing work.

---

### NFR003: Maintainability - Test Coverage and Code Quality

**Description**: All code must maintain high test coverage and quality standards. Test coverage must be 80% or higher for all new code, all modules must have unit tests with isolated dependencies, integration tests must cover critical user workflows end-to-end, linting must pass with zero errors or warnings, and code must follow consistent style guidelines enforced by automated tools.

**Metric**: Test coverage percentage measured by Vitest coverage reporter, lint error count from ESLint

**Target**:
- Test coverage: 80%+ (measured by Vitest)
- Unit test coverage: 85%+ for core modules
- Integration test coverage: 100% of critical user workflows
- Lint errors: 0 (measured by ESLint)
- Code complexity: Cyclomatic complexity <10 per function

**Rationale**: High test coverage prevents regressions and ensures reliability. Lint-free code is easier to maintain and has fewer bugs. Consistent style improves readability and collaboration.

---

### NFR004: Compatibility - Cross-Platform and Node Version Support

**Description**: SpecKit must work consistently across all major platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows) and Node.js versions (18.x, 20.x, 22.x LTS). All file paths must use platform-independent path APIs, all shell commands must have platform-specific implementations or fallbacks, and all features must be tested on each supported platform and Node version in CI pipeline.

**Metric**: Platform compatibility matrix showing pass/fail status for each platform and Node version combination

**Target**:
- 100% feature parity across Linux, macOS, Windows
- 100% test pass rate on Node.js 18.x, 20.x, 22.x
- 0 platform-specific bugs in production
- CI pipeline validates all platforms and Node versions

**Rationale**: Developers use diverse environments. Platform-specific bugs create friction and limit adoption. Cross-platform support ensures SpecKit works reliably for all users.

---

### NFR005: Security - Dependency Safety and Input Validation

**Description**: SpecKit must have zero runtime dependencies to minimize supply chain attack surface, all user inputs must be validated and sanitized before processing, file operations must validate paths to prevent directory traversal attacks, and all dependencies (dev only) must be audited regularly for known vulnerabilities using npm audit.

**Metric**: Number of runtime dependencies (must be 0), number of high/critical vulnerabilities in npm audit

**Target**:
- Runtime dependencies: 0
- High/critical npm audit vulnerabilities: 0
- Input validation coverage: 100% of user inputs validated
- Path traversal protection: 100% of file operations validated

**Rationale**: Dependencies introduce security risks and maintenance burden. Zero runtime dependencies eliminates supply chain attack vectors. Input validation prevents injection attacks and malicious inputs.
