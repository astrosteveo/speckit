# Constitute Phase - Define Project Principles

You are guiding the user through the **Constitute** phase of the SpecKit workflow.

## Current Phase: CONSTITUTE

**Goal**: Define the project's core principles, values, and architectural guidelines.

## Your Task

1. **Check Workflow State**
   - Read `.speckit/state.json` to verify current phase
   - Ensure workflow is in "not_started" or "constitute" phase
   - If in a later phase, ask user if they want to re-run constitute

2. **Load Constitution Template**
   - Read `.speckit/templates/constitution.md` (if exists)
   - Or use default constitution template

3. **Guide Constitution Creation**

   Ask the user these key questions:

   a) **Project Vision**: What is the primary goal of this project?

   b) **Core Values**: What principles should guide development?
      - Examples: Simplicity, Performance, Security, Accessibility

   c) **Technology Constraints**: Any required or forbidden technologies?

   d) **Quality Standards**: What defines "done"?
      - Test coverage requirements
      - Code review requirements
      - Documentation requirements

   e) **Development Principles**: How should code be written?
      - DRY, SOLID, KISS principles
      - Naming conventions
      - Error handling philosophy

4. **Create CONSTITUTION.md**
   - Write `.speckit/CONSTITUTION.md` with the agreed principles
   - Include sections: Vision, Core Values, Technology Stack, Quality Standards, Development Principles
   - Make it clear, actionable, and specific

5. **Update Workflow State**
   - Mark constitute phase as complete in `.speckit/state.json`
   - Set next phase to "specify"

6. **Create Quality Report**
   - Validate the constitution (clarity, completeness, actionability)
   - Write `.speckit/quality/constitution-quality.json` with scores

7. **Next Steps**
   - Show success message
   - Suggest running `/specify` to move to next phase
   - Or `speckit specify` via CLI

## Constitution Template

Use this structure:

```markdown
# Project Constitution

## Vision
[What are we building and why?]

## Core Values
1. [Value 1]: [Description]
2. [Value 2]: [Description]
3. [Value 3]: [Description]

## Technology Stack
- **Language**: [e.g., TypeScript, Python]
- **Framework**: [e.g., React, Express]
- **Database**: [e.g., PostgreSQL]
- **Testing**: [e.g., Vitest, Pytest]

## Quality Standards
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum X% coverage
- **Code Review**: All code must be reviewed
- **Documentation**: All public APIs must be documented

## Development Principles
1. **Simplicity First**: Prefer simple solutions over clever ones
2. **Test-Driven**: Write tests before implementation
3. **Incremental**: Ship small, working changes frequently
4. [Add more principles...]

## Constraints
- **Must have**: [Required features/technologies]
- **Must not have**: [Forbidden approaches]
- **Performance**: [Specific requirements]
- **Security**: [Security requirements]
```

## Important Notes

- Be conversational and helpful
- Ask clarifying questions to understand the project
- Don't assume - get specific details from the user
- Make the constitution actionable, not abstract
- Keep it concise (1-2 pages max)

**Remember**: A good constitution makes the rest of the workflow much smoother!
