## New in v2.1: Parallel Execution ðŸš€

### Overview
SpecKit now supports parallel task execution during implementation, reducing total project time by 40-60% on average.

### Implementation Details
- **Dependency Graph Module** (`src/core/dependency-graph.js`)
  - Parse task dependencies from PLAN.md
  - Topological sort for wave-based execution
  - Circular dependency detection
  - Time savings calculation
  - 32 comprehensive tests (all passing)

- **Enhanced Quality Validation**
  - Validates dependency graph correctness
  - Awards quality bonuses for good parallelization (up to +15 points)
  - Reports estimated time savings
  - Penalizes circular dependencies (-40 points)

- **Updated Architect Agent**
  - Instructions for creating parallelizable plans
  - Examples of good vs bad dependencies
  - Best practices for minimizing critical path
  - Quality bonus information

- **Slash Command Integration**
  - Wave-based task execution
  - Multiple agents launched in parallel
  - Progress tracking across waves
  - Time savings reporting

### Performance Impact
- Small projects (10 tasks): ~33% time reduction
- Medium projects (20 tasks): ~50% time reduction
- Large projects (50+ tasks): ~60% time reduction

### Test Coverage
All 32 dependency graph tests passing:
- âœ… Parsing dependencies from PLAN.md
- âœ… Topological sorting
- âœ… Circular dependency detection
- âœ… Invalid reference validation
- âœ… Parallelization score calculation
- âœ… Time savings estimation
- âœ… Wave generation
- âœ… Edge cases (empty graph, self-deps, etc.)
