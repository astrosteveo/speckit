## Development Methodology

This project follows **Spec-Driven, Test-Driven Development**:

1. **Specify**: Define what needs to be built (clear requirements)
2. **Plan**: Break down into testable tasks
3. **Implement**: Build with TDD (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)
4. **Validate**: Quality gates ensure we stay on track
